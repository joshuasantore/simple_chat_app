# A Simple Chat App

I made this in a couple hours, basically just testing out websockets.

It's not much to look at, nor is it especially complex, nor is the code even remotely clean just a learning exercise.

#

To try it out, clone the project and then run

```
yarn start
```

The server will then launch on port 8080 or whatever port you have specified in the environment variables.

Try connecting and sending messages from multiple devices(that are all on the same network of course...)

That's really all there is to it.

#

PS. Messages wont send unless you specify a user, but it's setup so that once you specify your user, it gets stored in cookies and auto filled the next time you enter the site.
